# BMI Calculator

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

```
BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (m^2)
```

Interpretations:
* Under 18.5 they are **underweight**
* Over 18.5 but below 25, they have a **normal weight**
* Over 25 but below 30, they are **overweight**
* Over 30 but below 35 they are **obese**
* Above 35 they are **clinically obese**
